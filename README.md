# Travel Expedition

## Techical Requirements

Make a single page application using asynchronous loading, utalising two APIs, has standard user profile flow, and users have the ability to add cards to categories in a bookmarking-like functionality. 

## Stack

Ruby on Rails 
jQuery
Ajax

## Apis

- Emergency Number API
- Currency Exchange API

## The Problem

There are many booking marking apps out there, but when it comes to travel, we don't want to trawl through 100's of baking recipies and fitspo pictures. Travellers are passionate, always seeking information, looking out for tips and secrets. But the information gets lost. Scraps of paper get washed. 

##Our Solution 

We offer a dedicated travel bookmarking list that you use daily while at home, and can sort and view your dream places quickly while you are abroad.
